Guru
====

Not a typical ninja inside your company.

**What is this?**

This is an attempt to make [Hubot](http://hubot.github.com/) the guru inside your organization.

**I don't get it**

What if a chat bot could collect group knowledge and answer your questions, just like any mentor or senior developer would do?

**What about wikis?**

Wikis are great but extensive for everyday troubleshooting.

**And FAQs?**

Too static.

**Ok, I see what you did there**

The Singularity is near.
